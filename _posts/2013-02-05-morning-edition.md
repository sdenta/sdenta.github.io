## Here are my efforts to maintain good mood, for the whole day… and it always starts with  more than a good morning.

## **Wake up early**

I always try my best to get my arse off the bed by 5.30, knowing that I am able to be one of the rare early riser by choice is good enough to make me feel good enough.

## **Sweating**

Sweat is nothing but the tears of our fat, 30’ short run or walk around my apartment is what I need every morning to boost both my mood and energy level. Plus, who can resist the extra endorphin and smiles beautifully crafted coming from the girls next door.

## **Breakfast**

I’m such a filthy eater, satisfying my gluttony is the key I can still survive until now. Cinnamon French toast + fresh milk is the ideal. But I can be satisfied easily with toast and nutella or a bowl of whole grain cereal.

## **Shower**

Great day will never begin until we have a great shower. I like to invest my 15 minutes in a fabulous shower experience. It’s long enough for a guy like me having a bath more than 60 seconds period, but the evidences have proved that with a great shower, comes a great mood and times. I like my shower like James Bond’s, no definitely not with random chick sucking out my uvula under the shower, but I do it with starting off my water warm and nice, and then turn it down to cold for the last few minutes.

## **Leaving early**

If you’re like me, inhabitant of a huge city with its traffic bad enough swearing is the only back sound you can hear, leaving early is what you need. If I left my place late, the “in a rush” feeling will easily break my mood down into pieces.
