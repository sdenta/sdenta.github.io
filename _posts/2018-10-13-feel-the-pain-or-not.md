There is this thing I always do every morning, my _aperetivo_ and _antipasto_ by the time I reach the hospital and do my job. An overture of my daily bonding with any patient I have at that time.

I check for the pain scale, the intensity of pain that is currently felt by the patient. I can measure it in several ways depending on the age or patient's condition, whether by looking at their behavioral, facial expression, or by asking them the literal question

> On a scale of 1 to 10, how would you rate your pain?

Sometimes I couldn't help but think, would it be nice if I was asked the same question everyday, like if any person would check me regularly every morning, how much pain am I bearing at that particular time?

Not that I am in a constant pain or what. I appreciate my life as it is, plenty of things I am having now are actually beyond my wildest expectation any time before.

A friendly reminder, I would like to call it. A regular check on pain would be a friendly reminder that we are still able to feel discomfort for anything that is making us in pain at any level.

A friendly remember that most of the time pain is actually good for us, like the pain of touching an effing hot kettle makes us withdraw our hand so it cannot burn our finger any worse.

Pain offers so many lesson, like it is okay to feel sad after the last goodbye or unreturned hello. Like it is okay that life can sometimes offer a symphony of disappointment without apology or any explanation at all. Like whatever it is happening in our life, we are never truly alone.

Pain can be frustrating, depressing feeling that string along us like smeared gum under the shoes. But the thing is, pain often offers a ticket for us to ride a vessel of all good tales that are in life's keeping, and sometimes embracing pain is what it takes so we can find our way back to a place called home and maybe

So we can finally get the closure that we have been longing for.

We just need to know how actually,

Or when.
