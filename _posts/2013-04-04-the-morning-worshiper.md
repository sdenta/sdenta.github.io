Some of my friends might have known me for my peculiar pretentious obsession of morning time. And that is quite unequivocally just right.

Morning time defines the rest of my day, if morning was bad, my day would be quite as bad or even worse, but if the morning was great, I could expect to be powerful enough to shut Kim Jong-Un's mouth from threatening the rest of the world. I find it so sacred that I worship morning time with my pure heart and soul.

There's this magical ether during morning period, that's just the bestest time of the day to raise your mood and energy level as the sun is rising. Me, I do everything i could do to boost my mood and energy, get up as early as possible, take a fantastic shower, spend ultimate breakfast, coffee, exercise, spare time for celestial communication with God Being. anything, anything for a great morning.

Heaven's door is open during the morning, or at least I think so, that's why i feel so screwed up every time I woke up late and miss the magical smells of my invaluable morning time.

Those who worship the morning will own the world... or at least I think so...:-)
