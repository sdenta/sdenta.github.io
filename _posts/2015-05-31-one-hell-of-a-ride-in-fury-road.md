George Miller, a 70 yrs old grandpa might have taught hundreds of action flicks director or the likes on how to tell a story that will not only blow your mind and electrify your eyes, but also to ridiculously overstimulate the production of testosterone in so many level only God knows how to stop it.

I am not really a fan of post apocalyptic theme of movie. Rarely I can enjoy the redundant interpretation of the world's end overburdened with a batch of obtuse and spoilt casts which clearly did not have any idea or even a tiny glimpse of how does a post armagedon time look like. No wonder they will try to compensate all the silly flaws and loophole with dark and (over) edgy tone of the movie

But boy mad max fury road is fucking breathtaking, magnificent, stunning, mind-boggling, mind-blowing, jaw-dropping, etc you can copy the whole series of exaggerating adjectives from oxford dictionary but could never get close to describe the level of epicness grandpa Miller delivers in this movie.

I did not watch the previous installments of the series with Mel Gibson as Max but Tom Hardy definitely pulled it off. Tom Hardy knows how to enact perfection. Charlize Theton also made me go wow, I have no idea this lady can transform herself from an elegant role in prometheus to a formidable yet almost hopeless one in fury road. And Rosie Huntington, what a nice comeback from that insulting almost imbecile act in transformer. I love you for that kak Ros.

My honest and humble suggestion for people to enjoy the movie would be.. First, watch it on the biggest and loudest screen possible. Second, it's the kind of -either you extremely like it or hate it- movie so though plenty of testosterone junkies put this movie on the pedestal, you might have ended up with plenty of annoying what-the-fuck moments as you left the cinema. Third, if possible, do not blink.

My knees were trembling so hard while watching this gullible story of a man with a group of tough yet angelic ladies going back and forth accross the desert chasing hopes. I cant stop bleeding figuratively through my nose and at one point I was quite sure there was overflowing testosterone squirting out from every opening in my body.

Oh, and thanks to Mad Max for making another car chasing movies going all like freaking super mario kart. Yes fast n furious installments, I am pointing my figurative furiosa-ly prosthetic finger at you!
