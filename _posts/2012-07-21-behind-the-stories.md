When is the last time you were mesmerized by a story? Was it the latest movie you watched? or the hottest gossip of the girl next door?

We live essentially in a big world of omnibus, every one of us have our own story. Every single fact, every single case, reason, motives. There's always a story behind that. Realizing how important story is to us will help us to comprehend this world more precisely and beautifully.

What is it so important with a story? Does our life have anything to do with any stories we have encountered so far? yes it does, our life depends on every story we have and how we understand it is essential in our fight to maintain our kind on the top of evolution class.

Humans are not ideally set up to understand logic, they are ideally set up to understand stories (Roger C Shank). We will always comprehend the problems around us easier if we got the story behind that. Our decision in life is based on solely of stories following the options.

By understanding the stories, it will help us capture the essences of elements that is abandoned by formal decision methods. In this era of fast and abundant information, we always try to understand everything with logic, we put logic on pedestal as if it is the truest way to get over every problems in our life.

The thing about logic, it has flaws. Logic will generalize things, depends on prior facts or common understanding and believe. Logic will undress our decision from the context and emotion. Stories are important, for they engages our understanding into one neat set of facts, logic, knowledge, meaning and emotion.

I am not saying that we have to put aside logic in every decision, I am saying that story is the base of everything we believe in, put our logic in the context, find a story behind the problem, and together with the captured emotion, we will see things clearer, we can put the necessary facts and information to the proper place like a building blocks we use to assemble our decision.

So, never under estimate any story you heard. It might save your life sometimes in the future..

Kudos! : )
