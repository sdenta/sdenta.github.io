It's been almost 2 years since the last time I wrote a piece. I miss writing like I miss having a good brunch in saturday morning at Loewe. It is therapeutical to say the least, my go to place everytime life sucks me so bad. The change of place and pace really had me taking off my previous rhythm completely. Never I ever had to have a such erratic timeline in a week like what I am having on my plate at this period of time.

Yes, this is an _I-am-back-to-clinical-works_ period of time. As a doctor, treating real patients. To make it even more complicated, I am a resident. A medical graduate engaged in specialized practice under supervision in a hospital. So every specialist you met in the hospital or private practice. They had to pass this period also, the residency period.

What's with the residency period? Nothing, just a period when a doctor has to endure the most painful 4-6 years in their life transforming their skill and knowledge to a slightly upgraded version, the 2.0 or so version of their professional level.

Why painful? Not sure though. Why not sure? Because (1) I don't know how to elaborate it delicately and (2) I don't care about the pain, the pain is inevitable, the suffering on the other hand, is optional. There is this paradox I always put inside my mind as deep as possible.

> The pain paradox. The more you fight the pain, the more pain you have to endure.

Oh, and I moved also. Not staying in the same city that nurtured me for the past 8 years. Kind of sad, actually, since I've fallen in love with the city even before me realizing it, with the good and the bad, the full and the void. The feeling that you can only get when you drive your car on the highway after midnight while whispering any random folk song that you can find on the radio. The emptiness that you can enjoy while riding an empty elevator up to your apartment, reflecting on no matter how much the city will screw you, she will still bring nothing but the best of you.

And life goes on. Is it worth it? Maybe, we never know. But if you asked me why should I leave my prime and start from scratch. It is not because I am looking for worthiness honestly. Who am I to deserve such a worthy life. I think I am doing this as I have to keep moving. Status quo, as Reagen once said, is a latin for the mess we're in. It is uncomfortable per se to challenge the status quo.

Too bad I dont have the luxury of having the choice other than confronting the status quo, my comfort zone.

But hey, this is life, is it not?
