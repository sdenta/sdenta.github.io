In the fasting month of 2014, during the 22nd nights of July, an election committee of the third biggest democracy nation on earth finally announced and declared Joko Widodo and Jusuf Kalla to be president and the vice of Republic of Indonesia for the year 2014 – 2019.

Though the process is not yet finished, there are still few months before the inauguration, many people had already expressed their biggest relief for the toughest months of presidential election had almost come to its end. This nation was literally only few weeks apart from being ripped off by the lies, angers, defamation, coming from the contestation of both candidates. The 2014 Presidential Election is definitely the tightest, most tiring, most frustrating election I had ever experienced since the time I was eligible to actively involved in any democracy process here in the country.

Still, I should say I am happy with the result. Being a Jokowi supporter since the day he changed a small unattractive disordered city in central Java to become one stunningly jaw-droppingly beautiful place, I was never expecting him to become the nation leader this fast, and comparing to the other candidate who had almost unlimited resources, dominated the media, and supported by the biggest coalition party, the picture of Joko Widodo becoming my new president this year was quite a dubious concept.

Once saw him in Plasa Indonesia, in a place surreal enough for anyone to meet a public official, a 21 cineplex. He was only accompanied by his daughter, no personal body guard like we usually see always hanging around other officials even only those small town mayor, his little figure was definitely easily ignored by everyone even the security, few seconds after Jokowi passed him, had to ask his friend “was it Jokowi our governor just now?”

He is just like most Indonesian, no presidential figure what so ever no wonder one of the reason why people didn’t want to vote for him was because of his lacking of formidable figure. You can put on any attire to him and would still suit him in a very comical way, if he was the one disguised as poor people on TV, not the big strong general figure Wiranto, the reality show would probably never finished as the crew would lost Jokowi among the throng of poor people in the street.

That ordinary people looks along with his well known integrity and reputation were surely what make more than 70 million, almost three times the human populating the whole Australia, voted for him this year, and not only voted, but literally putting the biggest hope and expectations on the shoulder of former slump kid – furniture exporter, Joko Widodo.

The biggest test God could give to human being is now being given to Joko Widodo. He is leading one of the most promising yet perplexed country in the world. We could even feel the air of excitement that keep rippling through the social media. Supporters shaved their head in mania, friends broadcasting messages with absurd yet hilarious oh-God-i-cant-believe-we-win expressions. Everywhere he went, people will line up chaotically just to cheer his name and shake his hand. Many of the world leaders, the press, celebrities, selebtwits, metal heads, even the ordinary people are far from stopping their endless display of adulation to Joko Widodo, but it was not even closed to the faintest prelude of what awaiting him in Istana Negara, a mixed crowd of noble supporter and dubious opportunist and back stabber, eerie as it is.

Realizing the fact that he is only human, very susceptible to devilish temptations coming from limitless power like corruption or even sexual frenzy, we should refuse to stay still and letting Jokowi do all the works. Our fights are not reaching the end by the time people inaugurate Jokowi as the president, yet it is only the beginning. I gave my vote for Jokowi not solely so I can rely all my fate on him, he is only an individual after all, and my fate is depending only on myself. I voted for him so he can become a good leader and example for us to move together. We should walk and run with him leaving no room for any despicable traitor in our vessel of change.

Joko Widodo our president, do not underestimate the power of the people who had survived from genocidal trial to massive natural disaster, you have the options of leading us to become one of the greatest country or betraying the trust of the people who had given every remaining faith in Indonesia, to you.

Please, dear Mr. President, please choose wisely…
