After 2 months, couple of ecstatic weekends, and few drowsy midweeks, finally i am in touch with my blog again. It's not like i do not have enough time to write, it's the nagging habit of mine when i am constantly attacked with writing block, chronic.. Classic me..

So what makes me starts writing again? it's the little book titled "Happiness Project" by Gretchen Rubin, a memoir of a writer who dedicate her full year to chase happiness in her very own city, very own life, very own kitchen, it's like a humble version of Gilbert's Eat, Pray, and Love.

She wrote all her efforts to be happy in that year. One of the postulate that i really like from happiness, is that happiness comes from the feeling of actually finishing something, could be your work, your appointments, or even your nagging errands..

And this, writing, is such a nagging task i feel like my life is incomplete before i actually wrote something.. that's why i tweet so much, but damn you twitter, a tweet is not actually a piece of writing, thank you for the fake orgasm feeling after a tweet like i just actually wrote something.. which is not, a tweet is a tweet, not a writing.

So, let me do this, "Sweeping declaration!" i will write at least a piece of writing in my blog every week about anything.. Â I shall not overthink what i will write, nor bother with the content of my writing..

\*finger crossed\*

Anyway, Rubin's Happiness Project is really a good reading, you can get one from amazon or any major book stores near you..
