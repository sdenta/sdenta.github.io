My Monday always goes pretty much the same as any other monday in this entire universe, it goes intimidating, franticallyÂ traumatizing, and yes of course, tiring. My expectation of monday never be higher than staying sober enough to survive the day, and with my proven ability to survive the peculiar post-saturday night, I am always confidence enough to live up my low monday's expectation.

The reason why frightening monday exists for me is actually because it is simply the beginning of the entire week, like it's the entrance to magical world of endless and blurry real life. Monday always demands a proof, are we good enough? do we deserve what we pursue? Monday will struck our head hard enough, it keep questioning us for the reasons, reasons for our existence.

Most of us still believe that the closer we are with success, the closer we are too with happiness. And monday is just a right day to start making accomplishment, it's supposed. Now, what makes us so sure, if we get the success, we will also get the happiness?

The thing about human is, our definition of success is never limited only by single definition, success will always develop and outgrow our previous definition. If we think getting a million is such a success, than by the time we really get a million, we already have another new definition of success, getting two million, for instance. If we get success in monday, there are always tuesday, wednesday and zillions days afterwards waiting to be the list of our successfulness.

If that's what happened, then when can we get to meet with our happiness? That is why now i learn to not relating success and happiness as a temporal event that happiness shall be happened only after success. I changed my believe into, Happiness comes first, success will follow.

There's a reason why i strongly believe that happiness will bring me closer to my success. When i am happy, i tend to do anything with the best i could do as a human. Because i am happy, I fell lighter in doing my obligation, i see clearer, i become more productive, i have more energy, more enthusiasm and as the result, i will get my target well achieved enough to deserve a strawberry cheesecake haagenz dazs ice cream for my bonus.

There's this happiness advantage that i thing you already know, when we are happy, our level of energy rises, along with our intelligence and creativity. How can we do that? we do that by changing the way we perceive our environment, i know you probably tired with the cliche of being positive, but it's cliche for a reason, it is cliche because it works. Try not to focus on the competition, the stressful targets, or exaggerating hassels, but focus on the reasons why you do this in the first place, focus on being happy.

When we are happy, there is burst of dopamine (it's a neurotransmitter -kind of chemicals- in our brain, sorry i can be a annoyingly boring sometimes :p ) release involved, that brings another consequence, which is turning on our brain learning center that will boost our adaptive respond to the outside world. We are a better human when we are happy.

Another upside of put being happy on top of the list is that, if i can't get my success, it doesn't matter, because i know i am happy already. : )
