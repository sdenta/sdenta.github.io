Crowd of people were thronging burst into the narrow pedestrian out of the herd of office towers downtown, some were running as if they were just set free after being the hostages of the job they had for years. Some were just standing still waiting for their cab to stop, or not.

The night was hesitant to come, you can see a glimpse of sun meeting the moon halfway at the corner as if they were catching up after not seeing each other for some good times. We were slowly walking to the nearby diner, our favorite place close to your office, when you whispering slowly 5 words, scarier than any words I had heard before in my life. 5 words that made my heart stop beating then clearly making my pupil dilated fully in milliseconds of time.

> I think we should talk

I ignored it at first. Hoping it would be eventually washed out by the buzz of afterhour traffic.

> Are you listening? We need to talk.

### _Oh, of course, we can always talk cant we?_

I stuttered my answer nervously.

That was the worst dinner I have ever had in my life. Of course the talk you proposing on our walk to the diner was not about our trivial day update, not about my meeting with some global team for the local office plan next year, not about Keyla your annoying colleague who never stop stalking your day and talking bad behind you, or not about some random viral youtube clips nor the stupid celebrity gossips either.

Of course it was about you breaking up with me.

We were spending the time after ordering our food in silence. You ordered your food, I ordered mine, it felt weird, usually you would say both of our orders to the waitress, in the exact same order, confidently, every single time, you ordered salad with less dressing and extra crumbs for you, and ribs with no fries only wedges for me. It was a bit off and awkward spending the minutes togethers not talking. Until finally you broke the silence.

> I think we should not be together anymore.

I can see the words coming out clearly from your mouth, flew towards me slowly, choking me till I can barely breath. Darkness suddenly started to swell from the back of my head. I tried my best to pull off my flat face so you cannot see the pain growing inside me.

### _Oh.. you mean you are breaking up with me?_

I barely pull the words from my choking throat. It was hard to believe I would ever ask that question to you. Not after the convenient of life we started to build together, the next year plan, the random trips, the stupid fights, the house in suburb, the 3 kids we were going to raise, the triple job I had to take after I finish my specialty yet eventually I would still be happy knowing I will always come back home to you.

Suddenly all plans became past tenses.

You know I can be all analytical you explained the reasons of your proposal in a very logical way, with all the arguments and plausibilities of us not to be together. And to be honest, it was hard to disagree with your justifications. I came to realization that we were rarely spending time together anymore. I was so busy building my career, hopping from one country to another, you were so busy building yours, juggling between one mega project to another. The quality time we had, we only spent it by fighting over trivial things, then slept off it until the next morning hoping we forgot why we fought at the first place. In fact, the dinner we were having was actually the first time we met again after few weeks not seeing each others because of the endless business itineraries we both had to complete the past few weeks.

The relationship became toxic even before I knew it.

I was trying to counteract your arguments still. Sometimes in high pitch you needed to console me by rubbing my hands. Of course it worked, it always works. I was pretty sure you had spend time between your works when we did not meet to take some wizard short course to learn the spell to control me.

And after trying so hard not to sob like a kid losing his childhood dreams. You made me see the elephant in the room. The breaking up was not because of the little time we had together, it was because of the not-so-little egos that have been back and forth contradicting between us, and hurting us, burning us down little by little.

The most difficult part of the breaking up is wondering what will I become without you. You thought the same too, I guess, as implied in one of your argument. But seems like you already took that as your consideration. The pain will be growing worse if we continued become we.

You didn't even finish your food. You put down your fork, wiping your lips slowly with the napkin. I couldn't say nothing, I couldn't do nothing. I didnt even have energy to manage my head in proper position. You asked for the bill, paid the bill. I still said nothing. Setting you free took every last energy that I still had apparently.

Then you took off .

> I will send the rest of your stuffs to your place. Oki the office boy will come to your apartment to take my stuffs, if you don't mind

I still said nothing, it was so hard to compose even some simple words, my broca's area failed to almost nonexistence.

You turned around then walked away from me. After awhile, I rushed over out from the restaurant, I could still see your back walking through the crowd when I called out your name. You stopped for few seconds.

And then you walk again.

And that was it, my call was no longer your beacon.

Both of us, we were strangers again.
