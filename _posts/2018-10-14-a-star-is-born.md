Woke up late. Supposed to do a quick round and follow up of my patients since like an hour ago, but I am still here wearing my weird smells sweatshirt sipping a cup of coffee just oozed out from the machine, my fountain of contentment.

Couldn’t stop thinking about midnight show movie last night. A Star is Born.

Cooper and Gaga really nailed it, nailed it so bad. Turned out you can expect a great story directed by someone who’s played as silly raccoon from the other movie.

The truth is, the main reason I watched the movie because I saw the Kris Kristofferson and Barbara Streisand’s version of the story before when I was still very young and stupid and I really love Streisand so I didn’t expect Gaga can reach even until the same range as hers. I know she’s talented and all but boy this one will fill the void of any hearts out there with deep feels. She’s just simply amazing.

I love the pace, the notes, the octave, the rhythm of the movie. The overture is simple enough to introduce us to the characters, their motives, and their pain. The chorus is so smooth you can listen your feeling sings along with it. The bridge is breathtaking you can feel the struggle to take your next breath, and the climax part is so.. hm. how to put it delicately..

Not for the faint hearted.

I am glad I catch the show last night, I remember I bought Gaga’s concert ticket many years ago only to find out it was cancelled indefinitely, and by only watching her performance in this movie boy finally I can get my closure.
