I was looking for full moon the other night. For some random reason I felt the need to entertain my self by looking at the full moon from the balcony of my house. The time was 10ish at night. Perfect time, so I believed. The big billboard outside the main road just within the vicinity of my visual field every time I stand on my balcony had just been turned off. Now that the biggest light pollution was diminished, I believed I could be able to see the moon.

Unlucky for me, the sky was full packs of clouds gathering like there was huge midnight sales for the clouds up there. Only once or twice I can see the first full moon of the month peeked out from behind the clouds. As if telling me, I am here I am here, don't mind me, I just needed to take care of this fluffy clouds while the sun are not around, he is the one who's supposed to take care of them, but he's still dog tired after looking after the the rain the other day.

Dream is all about moon that I am looking for, there's this mystical thing about moon that somehow connected to my head every time I saw her so I am always ended up having a dream, not necessary good dreams, sometimes bad dreams, which I didn't mind. Because I love dreams. A dream may be the only window to the unknown, or best, window to the other universe. The universe when I am the richest person on the planet, or nobel prize winner, or even a Jedi. The moon is like the key to my dreaming jukebox.

Dreaming resonates with stories, maybe that's why I am still keeping and updating my dreaming journal as often as possible. To get stories, to build my own when I am awake. Without my own dreams, what am I supposed to do? I will be only left to live other people's dreams, build other people's stories.

I was waiting for the moon until what time I wasn't really quiet sure. Next time I know I was awaken when the rooster crowed the morning after at the first hint of light. No dreaming at all, guess the moon was really swamped by the endless clouds. It's okay, I still can use the stories from the dreams the day before.

So off to work shall I?
