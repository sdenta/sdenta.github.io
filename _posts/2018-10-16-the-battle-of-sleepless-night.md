The time is 00.44, yet our eyes still wide open, brain is fully awaked and heart is pumping nothing but caffeine into the bloodstream.  there's still around 6 hours left before wrapping up our shift. The unit is full packed with critical patients.There are 2 big screens blasting only real time updates of our patients, another 2 screens for searching the latest work ups, 1 screen for cctv live from each room and the alleys, and 10 monitors dedicated for each and every patient. Since we can't afford to miss any single detail, for any deviation could lead to crisis or even death in a blink of an eye.

We are in the PICU now, Pediatric Intensive Care Unit, which I believe from the name is quite self explanatory, it's a special unit in our hospital, dedicated for treating paediatric patients in critical condition with highest level of monitoring and medical care.

PICU shift sometimes can be as peaceful as  Dalai Lama Temple in Dharamsala, it is as cold as the Himalaya, it is so quiet and content we can only hear the sound of ventilator and the beep of the monitors humming like they were the monks praying in the monastery. Only under that condition, the oncall residents can spend their time in contentment. We could be just sitting in front of the monitor, in our energy saving mode, looking at the patients' chart dancing rhythmically on the monitor that could last for the rest of the shift. If that is what's happening, there are still plenty of space in our mind to think of some other worthy things beyond the hospital, like current situation in middle east or the unforgettable last goodbye kiss.

The other times PICU can be so chaotic and ugly, there is blood everywhere, high pitch beeping of the alarm, screaming out apnea and bradycardia, panicking parents, some crying broken-heartedly, nonstop howling the sound of pain. PICU can sometimes be our Syria. Battlefield of the residents that leave us nothing but PTSD.

Like any battlefield, there is a team. We are the team, three of us for each deployment, one chief and two soldiers supporting the mission, the roles will be turned over in each deployment, making sure every one of us had the chance to contribute in any assigned role. The premise is simple, one team of residents, 24 hours of shift, must do everything they could, to keep the patients alive, to reach their interventions target, before passing the patients to the respective assigned resident, the day after. There shall not be error, for any error means the patients one beat closer to the death.

Sometimes, the enemy strikes like a desert warfare, during daylight, they ambush our convoy during daily round with bradycardia and apnea, pushing our squad apart before we can consolidate to counter the attack with ABC strategy, making sure airway is clear, sometimes intubation strike is needed, breathing is optimal, circulation is settled. Adrenalin stat! The chief shouted to me while making sure the other soldier still pumping oxygen to the patient. Before he positions himself on the bed, prepare to do chest compression, if needed. Other team will call the parents, provide them update, prepare them to deal with the worst. Good Job! said our supervisor every time we can handle this kind of situation, achieving the four letter more beautiful for us than L.O.V.E, which is R.O.S.C (Return of Spontaneous Circulation).

Some other time the attack is like an ambush when we are still fully unprepared, like the battle of Mogadishu, strikes and shooting come towards us from all directions. There is one patient with history of status epilepticus, got seizure attack so bad, the bed is shaken so hard she almost jumped out of the bed. Another patient, post laparotomy with total resection of the colon, now is in hypovolemic shock after the ongoing loss of body liquid cannot be stopped after the fluid was leaking out from his gastric tube and nasal orifice. Of course to make things even chaotic, there should be another patient with apnea and bradycardia.

We cannot run away, because we don't have that choice. We have the privilege actually, to contribute, to save them, to defuse the complication, to fulfil the hopes, to help with the loss. Not because the patients need us, because no matter what, they will be what they will be, with or without us. If not us, there are still many doctors out there, chosen to be their doctors. We were chosen so we can be the vessel for their tales too. They save us the doctors as much as we save them.

After the endless fight, shout and frustration. After the sleepless night that drain each and every last energy of us. We sometimes still lose the battle.

Though sometimes I think that those who lose have the reasons that are more powerful that the one who win.

So no reason not to move on, no reason to not fighting another battle. For it might be the only reason for us to stay alive, to help others to stay alive.
