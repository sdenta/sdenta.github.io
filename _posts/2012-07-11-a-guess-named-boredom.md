In my daily attempt to survive in this insufferable wild world, boredom usually comes without any prior notice. I never heard boredom said “dear Mr Denta, it’s been a while since the last time I visited, shall I come and messing up your life again, sincerely Dull Humdrum Boredom.” So here he is, my lovely life has a guess named boredom knocking on my door and decided to give me a splendid visit.

Do you know how bored I am lately? I am so bored I just spent a morning eating muesli in a restaurant near my workplace together with some hippies from Europe and I think Australia. Yes, muesli, I am that bored.

No matter how smart you are with your anti-boredom system, they always can find a way to just slip in your everyday amazing life and screw one life you only have so far in a way you do not want to live in this planet anymore.

I decided not to fight this ugly feeling in hard way. Instead, I am trying to make boredom a good company, a decent inevitable feature of life that I will still deal with tremendous cheer.

Appreciate the now is how I cope with monotony. It’s a simple act with delightful result. How often we neglect the greatness of our life, taking everything in our life for granted?

I try to utilize all my senses to respect what I have at the moment. Looking with sweetest smile of mine at the traffic when all motorists honking and shouting each others. Brace the heat in the middle of the day with perkiness like those shampoo commercial model on TV.

Nothing beat boredom more than gratitude and decent respect of our life. We have our only one life, it will be ridiculous to spend even just moment with dull feeling, as if everything in the world were against us.

Life is one huge orchestra with everyone as the composer. We decide the music of our life. One we have realized that, we can make our own lovely composition every day to lift up our mood and teach boredom how to not messing up anymore.. :-)
