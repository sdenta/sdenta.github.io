[![Showing up Manifesto](images/path-2015-04-26-2334.jpg)](https://bydnta.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/path-2015-04-26-2334.jpg)

### _You have to show up._

Not for getting the applause, nor credit, nor admirer, nor follower.

You just show up.

Life is an experiment, stop over-thinking and start playing

Show what you have, give what you create, let go what you earn.

Today is the only certainty that we have, so start today, why the wait?

Do not wait for permission from others, do not ask for acknowledgement

Do not wait for perfection to come, perfection comes from consistently doing just good

Do not let perfection becomes the enemy of doing good

Do not assume, have facts, do not be the followers of conjectures

Following-your-passion is overrated, if you do not know what your passion, it's ok, keep moving

Explore, play, laugh, enjoy the process, we are all going to leave this life at one point later in time

Why should we waste it with negativity?

### _Life is short, travel often, eat plenty, drink coffee and keep showing up._
